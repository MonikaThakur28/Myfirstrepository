				<h5>FASHION PHOTOGRAPHY</h5>
				<p>It isn’t a question of enhancement through design. Whether an editor realizes it or not, design is part of what he does every time he prints the paper.</p>

				<h5>LIFESTYLE PHOTOGRAPHY</h5>
				<p>Design is how you treat your customers. If you treat them well from an environmental, emotional, and aesthetic standpoint, you’re doing good design.</p>

				<h2>Burning With The Idea</h2>
				<p>Lens Queen - a creative lifestyle photo studio making emotional photography communicate a story. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. </p>
				<p>And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you're not passionate enough from the start, you'll never stick it out. If you live each day as it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right. </p>
				<p>Isn’t it a great feeling to be in love? And by love, I mean the feeling of belongingness, caring, sharing, fighting and making up for the wrongs. But, think about it. Is it only restricted to all the above? Or can there be something more to it? We as an obscure part of your life define it as the shy smile due to the thoughts and the blush which breaks in or the comfort of the closeness you have within. Love stories are not written but lived every moment.. created with your warmth and felt with each other’s presence.</p>
				<p>What more can be asked for if the moments when every beat your heart skips is frozen for you? We want you to skip a beat the same way every time you see it and that’s where our role comes into the picture.. We want you to be the love birds and we will be your memory lanes through the years to come.</p>
